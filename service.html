      <h2>BMW NEPAL</h2>
      >
      <p> BMW cars are yet to officially launch in Nepal. However, there are various individuals who drive BMW cars in
        the road of Nepal. In some second hand market place you may find used BMW cars as well. One reason, why it isn’t
        officially here, could be its price. Even the lower end of BMW cars cost as much as high end cars in Nepal.
        Therefore, the market is very narrow in an already small market. However, scenario is changing as more people
        are into buying vehicles. This is shown by increasing number of sales of cars every year.Talking about BMW as
        global brand, it is a German multinational company with Headquarter in Munich, Bavaria. It stands for
        “Bayerische Motoren Werke“. Originally it used to produce aircraft engines. However lately, it is producing cars
        and motorcycles. It 2015 itself, it manufactured over 2 million motor vehicles. The company owns other popular
        brand such as Mini and Rolls Royce.
        Talking in the context of Nepal, very few own its models. In the past, Kings and few elites may have used BMW
        cars. However, you would see very few of its cars running in the road of Nepal.

      <h2>FARARI</h2>
      <p> In 2014, Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance.[3] In May 2012 the 1962 Ferrari
        250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, selling in a private transaction for US$38.1 million to
        American communications magnate Craig McCaw.[4]

        Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[5] In October 2014 Fiat
        Chrysler Automobiles N.V. announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A. from FCA; as of the announcement
        FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.[6][7][8] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established
        Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the
        subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York
        Stock Exchange.[9] Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was
        distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[10] The spin-off was
        completed on 3 January 2016

      <h2>FORD CAR</h2>
      <p> Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial
        workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these
        methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in
        1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from
        1999 to 2010.[7] In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury
        cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.

        Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the fifth-largest in the world
        (behind Toyota, VW, Hyundai-Kia and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production. At the end of 2010, Ford
        was the fifth largest automaker in Europe.[8] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through
        special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent voting rights.[9][4] During the financial crisis at the
        beginning of the 21st century, it was close to bankruptcy, but it has since returned to profitability.[10] Ford
        was the eighth-ranked overall American-based company in the 2010 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in
        2009 of $118.3 billion.[11] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[12] and employed about 213,000
        employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide. </p>

      <h2>LAND CRUISER</h2>
      <p> The 70 Series is a family of Toyota Land Cruiser models produced from 1984 until the present day. It replaced
        the 25-year-old 40 Series as the off-road workhorse of the Land Cruiser heritage, while the 60 Series (and later
        the 80, 90, 100, 120, 150 and 200 Series) developed into more comfortable passenger off-road vehicles. Despite
        major changes in styling and numerous technological updates, the 70 Series was designed to retain the off-road
        capabilities and durability for which the 40 Series had become known. The 70 Series was marketed throughout the
        world, except for countries like India, USA, Mexico, Brazil and Korea. As a celebration of the Land Cruiser 70's
        30th anniversary, Toyota temporarily marketed the Land Cruiser 70 series in the Japanese market for 12 months.

      <h2>LAMBO</h2>
      <p> Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in
        1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the
        Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for
        high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the
        wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after
        1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold
        it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom
        Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's
        Audi division.

        New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
        increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the
        subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.

        Lamborghini produces sports cars and V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini currently produces
        the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán along with the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine.

      <h2>BUGATTI CHIRON</h2>
      <p> The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engined two-seater sports car developed and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by
        Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. as the successor to the Bugatti Veyron.[6] The Chiron was first shown at the Geneva
        Motor Show on March 1, 2016.[7][8] The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car.The main
        carryover component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it
        is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,500 PS (1,479 bhp; 1,103 kW) at 6700
        rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) starting from 2000-6000 rpm. Its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport produces
        220 kW (299 PS; 295 bhp) less than the new Chiron, while the original Veyron produces 736 kW (1,001 PS; 987
        hp)[10].[11]

        Like its predecessor, the Veyron, it has a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex
        All-wheel drive system.[12][13][14] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[15]The Chiron
        can accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer,[4] 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph)
        in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test, the Chiron reached
        400 km/h (250 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[16]

      <h2>PAGNI HURRAYA</h2>
      <p> Pagani Automobili S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of sports cars and carbon fibre components. The company
        was founded in 1992 by Horacio Pagani and is based in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy.Horacio Pagani,
        who formerly managed Lamborghini's composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new
        company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the 25th Anniversary Countach,
        the Lamborghini LM002, the Lamborghini P140 design concept, and the Diablo. In the late 1980s, Pagani began
        designing his own car, then referred to as the "C8 Project". Pagani planned to rename the C8 the "Fangio F1" to
        honour his friend, the five-time Argentinian Formula One champion Juan Manuel Fangio.

        In 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and
        prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being
        tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply Pagani with V12
        engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3 million dollars.While it is an independent company, Pagani
        has a working relationship with Daimler AG, most notably with its Mercedes-AMG subsidiary. This is partly due to
        the fact that Fangio had suggested that Pagani approach Mercedes. The Zonda used increasingly advanced versions
        of the Mercedes-Benz M120 V12 engine; the initial version displaced 6.0L, but later Zondas used a 7.3L engine,
        later reverting to a race-tuned version of the original 6.0L version for the track exclusive Zonda R and its two
        other variants (Zonda R Evolución and Zonda Revolución). Moreover, Pagani also worked with Daimler in the
        development of the Chrysler supercar, the 2004 ME 412, when Chrysler was under the Daimler-Chrysler umbrella.
        Finally, the Mercedes-Benz M158 engine for the Pagani Huayra is a bespoke engine produced just for Pagani.
        Mercedes-Benz revised its M275 engine in order to reduce turbo lag and improve response. This resulted in new
        exhaust headers, new pistons, a new intake manifold, as well as new turbochargers.</p>
      <img class="w" src="./assets/images/valkyrie.png">
      <h2>ASTON MARTIN VALKYRIE</h2>
      <p> The Aston Martin Valkyrie (also called through its code-names as AM-RB 001 and Nebula) is a limited production
        hybrid electric sports car collaboratively built by Aston Martin, Red Bull Racing and several other
        manufacturers.The car contains a 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine tailored by Cosworth, which was
        initially planned to produce around 1,000 hp (746 kW; 1,014 PS), but it was later announced in June 2017 that
        the engine would produce 1,130 hp (843 kW; 1,146 PS). At the same time the power output was released, the weight
        was also mentioned, at 1,030 kg (2,271 lb), which surpasses the intended 1:1 power-to-weight ratio, with 1,097
        hp (818 kW; 1,112 PS) per ton.[19]

        A Rimac-built hybrid battery system, which performs as a KERS system, is installed along with the engine. The
        power is delivered by a 7-speed paddle-shift transmission constructed by Ricardo. The exhausts come out nearby
        the engine, similar to the ones from F1 race cars and the Porsche 918 Spyder.[20]

        Bosch supplies the Valkyrie's ECU unit, traction control system, and ESP, and brakes and callipers are provided
        by Alcon and Surface Transforms. The front and rear lights are constructed by Wipac. The car features all-carbon
        fibre bodywork[21] and is installed with a carbon fibre Monocell from manufacturer Multimatic.[22] Michelin
        supplies the Valkyrie with the company's high-performance Sport Cup 2 tyres, with 265/35-ZR20 at the front and
        325/30-ZR21 at the rear.[23] The wheels are constructed out of lightweight magnesium alloy (20" front, 21" rear)
        with race-spec centre-lock The car's wheels have a smaller diameter in comparison to the road car, with 18-inch
        wheels up front and down the rear.[26] This is to allow the Michelin racing tires (based on LMP1 race cars) to
        actually fit the car, with F1-inspired carbon-carbon brakes to aid braking performance. The car's interior
        heaters and infotainment screens have been removed, and have been replaced with racing counterparts.[25] The car
        will be able to perform 3.3 lateral G-forces in cornering and 3.5 G-forces in braking deceleration. Top speed is
        intended to be higher than the regular car, at 250 mph (402 km/h).[24] The car's exhaust have very minimal parts
        to silence the engine.[26]
